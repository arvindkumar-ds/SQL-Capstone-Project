# SQL Capstone Project - Amazon Sales Analysis
📊 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Amazon's sales data across three branches (Mandalay, Yangon, Naypyitaw) to uncover key insights into product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. By leveraging SQL, we perform data wrangling, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to drive meaningful business decisions.

The dataset contains 1,000 sales transactions with 17 columns, covering invoice details, customer information, product categories, sales revenue, taxes, and ratings.

📌 Key Analysis Areas
✅ Product Analysis – Identify top-performing product lines and areas for improvement.
✅ Sales Analysis – Examine trends, seasonal patterns, and revenue drivers.
✅ Customer Analysis – Segment customers based on purchase behavior and profitability.

🔍 Approach Used
🔹 Data Wrangling: Handling missing values, ensuring data integrity.
